While there are TONS of features in elixir that I think are fantastic&amp;hellip; off the top of my head:
OTP integration Concurrency model Runtime configuration Erlang VMs deployment system Phoenix and Phoenix&amp;rsquo;s websocket model Note: maybe I&amp;rsquo;ll revisit each of these in a follow up post if there&amp;rsquo;s enough interest
While some of the features above make Elixir a more compelling sell to upper management and clients - one feature not listed stands out to me as one of the most fun to use.</description></item></channel></rss>
