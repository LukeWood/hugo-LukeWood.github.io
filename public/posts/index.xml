I decided to turn my Cactus into a game prototype.
My beautiful cactus. Setup To get started I needed to take a 3d scan of my cactus. Recently an app called display.land was launched. The app lets you scan objects with your phone&amp;rsquo;s camera and turn them into 3d models.</description></item><item><title>Typescript Saved My Game's Performance</title><link>/posts/published/typescript_saved_my_game/</link><pubDate>Sun, 23 Feb 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/published/typescript_saved_my_game/</guid><description>Background For quite awhile bulletz.io was written in vanilla javascript. The only libraries I used were RxJs and Phoenix Websockets. Performance was top notch for quite awhile due to the lack of framework, highly customized rendering code, and a specialized engine. I regularly got complements on the performance and smoothness of rendering.
A screenshot of bulletz.io October 2019 Several comments came in via email, forums, and text message from friends commenting on the poor rendering performance of my game bulletz.</description></item><item><title>Decouple Your Javascript Using Event Driven Programming</title><link>/posts/published/frontend_bulletz_refactor/</link><pubDate>Thu, 11 Jul 2019 20:13:20 -0700</pubDate><guid>/posts/published/frontend_bulletz_refactor/</guid><description>I am the sole author of the web game bulletz.io. Recently I refactored the frontend&amp;rsquo;s codebase to more closely match that of the backend. The backend is written using the functional programming language Elixir while the frontend is written in Vanilla Javascript. The programming languages are vastly different and are based on entirely different paradigms.
Originally the frontend was written using a generic Object Oriented model. This led to a great deal of technical debt, complicated UI interactions, and overall confusing code.</description></item></channel></rss>
