      <description>Background The Open Telecom Platform (OTP) is a powerful set of libraries essential to the success of erlang in the building of massively scalable soft real-time systems with requirements on high availability. One of the greatest benefits of using Elixir to develop software is it&amp;rsquo;s seamless interop with erlang libraries (including those in OTP).
bulletz.io is a browser game built with Elixir and the phoenix framework.
This post will showcase the usage of OTP in bulletz.</description>

      <description>SURF | SKI | SWE This blog is dedicated to sharing knowledge on both technical and non-technical topics in a useful way for others.
The target demographic is primarily software engineers who may not have been exposed to some of my niche areas of knowledge.
Each blog post has a picture of the place I was when I wrote it. I did this to add a little context to who I am as a person outside of my life as a developer.</description>
