      <description>Background Bulletz.io is a browser game I wrote entirely in Elixir using the phoenix framework. Bulletz.io is written to be highly fault tolerant and concurrent. This was important to me as I wanted to be able to run the game on a cheap server and leave it there long term without having to touch it.
This post will detail how I leveraged OTP to make bulletz.io fault tolerant and highly parallel.</description>

      <description>SURF | SKI | SWE This blog is dedicated to sharing knowledge on both technical and non-technical topics in a useful way for others.
The target demographic is primarily software engineers who may not have been exposed to some of my niche areas of knowledge.
Each blog post has a picture of the place I was when I wrote it. I did this to add a little context to who I am as a person outside of my life as a developer.</description>
