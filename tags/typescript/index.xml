The only libraries I used were RxJs and Phoenix Websockets. Performance was top notch for quite awhile due to the lack of framework, highly customized rendering code, and a specialized engine. I regularly got complements on the performance and smoothness of rendering.
A screenshot of bulletz.io October 2019 Several comments came in via email, forums, and text message from friends commenting on the poor rendering performance of my game bulletz.</description></item></channel></rss>
