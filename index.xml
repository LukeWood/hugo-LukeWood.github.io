While there are TONS of features in elixir that I think are fantastic&amp;hellip; off the top of my head:
OTP integration Concurrency model Runtime configuration CI/CD deployments Phoenix and Phoenix&amp;rsquo;s websocket model Note: maybe I&amp;rsquo;ll revisit each of these in a follow up post if there&amp;rsquo;s enough interest
While some of the features above make Elixir a more compelling sell to upper management and clients - one feature not listed stands out to me as one of the most fun to use.</description></item><item><title>Highschool Pic a Friend Recently Found</title><link>/surfing/highschool-pic/</link><pubDate>Sun, 15 Mar 2020 22:33:31 -0700</pubDate><guid>/surfing/highschool-pic/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Turning My Cactus into a Video Game</title><link>/posts/scanning_my_cactus/</link><pubDate>Mon, 16 Mar 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/scanning_my_cactus/</guid><description>Today I wanted to mess around with 3D model scanning. I decided to turn my Cactus into a game prototype.
My beautiful cactus. Setup To get started I needed to take a 3d scan of my cactus. Recently an app called display.land was launched. The app lets you scan objects with your phone&amp;rsquo;s camera and turn them into 3d models.</description></item><item><title>Typescript Saved My Game's Performance</title><link>/posts/typescript_saved_my_game/</link><pubDate>Sun, 23 Feb 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/typescript_saved_my_game/</guid><description>Background For quite awhile bulletz.io was written in vanilla javascript. The only libraries I used were RxJs and Phoenix Websockets. Performance was top notch for quite awhile due to the lack of framework, highly customized rendering code, and a specialized engine. I regularly got complements on the performance and smoothness of rendering.
A screenshot of bulletz.io October 2019 Several comments came in via email, forums, and text message from friends commenting on the poor rendering performance of my game bulletz.</description></item><item><title>OB Shorebreak with Steak</title><link>/surfing/ob-with-steak/</link><pubDate>Thu, 23 Jan 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/surfing/ob-with-steak/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Pleasure Point on Melissa's 8'6" Board</title><link>/surfing/pleasure-point-melissa/</link><pubDate>Sat, 18 Jan 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/surfing/pleasure-point-melissa/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Pleasure Point - 9'6 Michel Junod Log</title><link>/surfing/pleasure-point-junod/</link><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/surfing/pleasure-point-junod/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Fort Point Photo Gallery</title><link>/surfing/fort-point-gallery/</link><pubDate>Sat, 04 Jan 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/surfing/fort-point-gallery/</guid><description>0 b790 f f3 58 d1 466 b b e2 b 0 b2797 d66346 1 105 c

Recently I refactored the frontend&amp;rsquo;s codebase to more closely match that of the backend. The backend is written using the functional programming language Elixir while the frontend is written in Vanilla Javascript. The programming languages are vastly different and are based on entirely different paradigms.
Originally the frontend was written using a generic Object Oriented model. This led to a great deal of technical debt, complicated UI interactions, and overall confusing code.</description></item><item><title>Spam Text Classification with RNNs</title><link>/posts/spam-text-classifier/</link><pubDate>Thu, 18 May 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/spam-text-classifier/</guid><description>By Justin Ledford, Luke Wood, Traian Pop Business Understanding Data Background SMS messages play a huge role in a person&amp;rsquo;s life, and the confidentiality and integrity of said messages are of the highest priority to mobile carriers around the world. Due to this fact, many unlawful individuals and groups try and take advantage of the average consumer by flooding their inbox with spam, and while the majority of people successfully avoid it, there are people out there affected negatively by falling for false messages.</description></item><item><title/><link>/manifest.json</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/manifest.json</guid><description/></item><item><title/><link>/offline/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/offline/</guid><description>You&amp;rsquo;re Offline Sorry</description></item><item><title>8000net</title><link>/projects/8000net/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/projects/8000net/</guid><description>Developed the lecture material for an 8000 level machine learning course with 5 masters students and Dr. Eric Larson.
