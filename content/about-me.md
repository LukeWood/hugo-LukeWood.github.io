This blog is dedicated to sharing knowledge on both technical and non-technical
topics in a useful way for others.

The target demographic is primarily software engineers who may not have been
exposed to some of my niche areas of knowledge.

Each blog post has a picture of the place I was when I wrote it.  I did this to
add a little context to who I am as a person outside of my life as a developer.
I take all of the pictures shown in this blog.
