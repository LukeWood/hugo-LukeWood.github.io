Spam text message detector with **99.6% accuracy**  and **.9986 precision** on validation dataset.
Implemented by feeding [GloVe](https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/) embeddings into an [LSTM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_short-term_memory) or [GRU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gated_recurrent_unit) recurrent neural network [(RNN)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recurrent_neural_network).  Full details in the jupyter notebook.
